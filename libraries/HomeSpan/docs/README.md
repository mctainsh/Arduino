# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of [Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

HomeSpan is fully compatible with both Versions 1 and 2 of the [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).  Under Version 1, HomeSpan can be run only on the original ESP32.  Under Version 2, HomeSpan can be run on the original ESP32 as well as Espressif's ESP32-S2 and ESP32-C3 chips.

## ‚ùóLatest Update - HomeSpan 1.5.0 (2/20/2022)

* **New integrated library to control one- and two-wire Addressable RGB and RGBW LEDs and LED strips!**
  * Adds two new class:
    * **Pixel()** for control of one-wire RGB and RGBW LEDs and LED strips, such as this [NeoPixel RGBW LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2759)
    * **Dot()** for control of two-wire RGB LEDs and LED strips, such as this [DotStar RGB Strip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241)
    
  * See [HomeSpan Pixels](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/docs/Pixel.md) for full details, including a detailed tutorial sketch demonstrating different ways of using the **Pixel()** and **Dot()** classes, as well an advanced HomeSpan "HolidayLights" Project that shows how to develop custom special effects!

* **Increased the maximum number of simultaneous Controller connections from 8 to 14 (for Arduino-ESP32 version 2.0.1 and later)**
  * Added new method `reserveSocketConnection(uint8_t nSockets)` to the global homeSpan object that allows for better management of custom connections
  * Deprecated older `setMaxConnections(uint8_t nCon)` method

* **Additional updates include:**
  * Added new methods `setDescription(const char *desc)` and `setUnit(const char *unit)` to SpanCharacteristic.  Useful when creating and working with Custom Characteristics
  * Added new method `setStatusAutoOff(uint16_t duration)` to the global homeSpan object.  Causes the Status LED (if used) to automatically turn off after *duration* seconds.  Very handy for devices located in bedrooms or TV rooms!
  * Added new method `setPairCallback(func)` to the global homeSpan object.  Allows you to create custom actions whenever HomeSpan pairs or subsequently unpairs the device to the Home App
  * Added new method `deleteStoredValues()` to the global homeSpan object. Provides a programmatic way of deleting the value settings of all Characteristics stored in the NVS

See [Releases](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/releases) for details on all changes and bug fixes included in this update.

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming should download Apple's [HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/). The download is free, but Apple requires you to register your Apple ID for access to the document.

You ***do not*** need to read the entire document.  The whole point of HomeSpan is that it implements all the required HAP operations under the hood so you can focus on just programming whatever logic is needed to control your real-world appliances (lights, fans, RF remote controls, etc.) with the device.  However, you will find Chapters 8 and 9 of the HAP guide to be an invaluable reference as it lists and describes all of the Services and Characteristics implemented in HomeSpan, many of which you will routinely utilize in your own HomeSpan sketches.
