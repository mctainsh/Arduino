# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of [Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

HomeSpan is fully compatible with both Versions 1 and 2 of the [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).  Under Version 1, HomeSpan can be run only on the original ESP32.  Under Version 2, HomeSpan can be run on the original ESP32 as well as Espressif's ESP32-S2 and ESP32-C3 chips.

## ‚ùóLatest Update - HomeSpan 1.5.1 (4/17/2022)

* **New Web Logging functionality**
  * HomeSpan can now host a Web Log page for message logging
  * New WEBLOG() macro makes is easy to create user-defined log messages
  * Provides for the optional use of an NTP Time Server to set the device clock so all messages can be properly timestamped
  * See [HomeSpan Message Logging](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/docs/Logging.md) for full details

* **New *printf*-style formatting for LOG() macros**
  * Adds variadic forms of the LOG0(), LOG1(), and LOG2() macros so they can be used in the same manner as a standard C printf function
  * Greatly simplifies the creation of log messages 
  * See [HomeSpan Message Logging](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/docs/Logging.md) for full details

* **New CUSTOM_SERV() macro**
  * Allows for the creation of Custom Services
  * Can be used in conjunction with the existing CUSTOM_CHAR() macro to produce Services beyond those provided in HAP-R2
  * Includes a fully worked example of a custom [Pressure Sensor Accessory](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/Other%20Examples/CustomService) that is recognized by *Eve for HomeKit*
  * See [HomeSpan API Reference](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/docs/Reference.md) for details

* **New "Safe-Load" mode for OTA updates**
  * HomeSpan can check to make sure the new sketch being uploaded via OTA is another HomeSpan sketch.  If not, the upload fails
  * Upon rebooting after an OTA update, HomeSpan checks to ensure that OTA is enabled in the updated sketch.  If not, HomeSpan rolls back to the previous version of the sketch
  * See [HomeSpan OTA](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/docs/OTA.md) for full details
  
* **Additional updates include:**
  * a new (optional) argument to `SpanUserCommand()` that allows for passing a pointer to any arbitrary data structure
  * a new SPAN_ACCESSORY() macro that expands to a common snippet of code often used when creating Accessories 
  * refreshed and streamlined example Tutorials, and fully reworked Examples 7 and 11, to best conform with Home App behavior under iOS 15.4

See [Releases](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/releases) for details on all changes and bug fixes included in this update.

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming should download Apple's [HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/). The download is free, but Apple requires you to register your Apple ID for access to the document.

You ***do not*** need to read the entire document.  The whole point of HomeSpan is that it implements all the required HAP operations under the hood so you can focus on just programming whatever logic is needed to control your real-world appliances (lights, fans, RF remote controls, etc.) with the device.  However, you will find Chapters 8 and 9 of the HAP guide to be an invaluable reference as it lists and describes all of the Services and Characteristics implemented in HomeSpan, many of which you will routinely utilize in your own HomeSpan sketches.
