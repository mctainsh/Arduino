# HomeKit Primer

*(editing in progress)*

The standard reference for all HomeKit devices is  [Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/support/homekit-accessory-protocol/).  HomeSpan rigorously implements HAP-R2, so if you are already familiar with HomeKit concepts and terminology, using HomeSpan to create your own HomeKit devices should be extremely easy. However, if this is your first time programming for HomeKit, some of the basic HomeKit terminology can be confusing, and unfortunately Apple's HAP-R2 guide does not provide much in the way of an introduction or overview to HomeKit itself.  This page hopefully provides you with the missing "overview" you need to better understand the overall HomeKit ecosystem.
