# Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

The ESP32 has up to 16 PWM channels that can be used to drive a variety of devices.  HomeSpan includes an integrated PWM library with dedicated classes designed for controlling **Dimmable LEDs** as well as **Servo Motors**.  Both classes are provided in a standalone header file that is accessed by placing the following near the top of your sketch:

`#include "extras/PwmPin.h"`

## *LedPin(uint8_t pin [,float level [,uint16_t frequency]])*

Creating an instance of this **class** configures the specified *pin* to output a PWM signal suitable for a controlling dimmable LED.  Arguments, along with their defaults if left unspecified, are as follows:

  * *pin* - the pin on which the PWM control signal will be output
  * *level* - sets the initial %duty-cycle of the PWM from from 0 (LED completely off) to 100 (LED fully on).  Default=0 (LED initially off)
  * *frequency* - sets the PWM frequency, in Hz, from 1-65535 (ESP32 only) or 5-65535 (ESP32-S2 and ESP32-C3).  Defaults to 5000 Hz if unspecified, or if set to 0
 
 The following methods are supported:

* `void set(float level)`

  * sets the PWM %duty-cycle to *level*, where *level* ranges from 0 (LED completely off) to 100 (LED fully on)
  
* `int getPin()`

  * returns the pin number (or -1 if LedPin was not successfully initialized)
  
LedPin also includes a static class function that converts Hue/Saturation/Brightness values (typically used by HomeKit) to Red/Green/Blue values (typically used to control multi-color LEDS).

* `static void HSVtoRGB(float h, float s, float v, float *r, float *g, float *b)`

  * *h* - input Hue value, range 0-360
  * *s* - input Saturation value, range 0-1
  * *v* - input Brightness value, range 0-1
  * *r* - output Red value, range 0-1
  * *g* - output Green value, range 0-1
  * *b* - output Blue value, range 0-1

See tutorial sketch [#10 (RGB_LED)](../examples/10-RGB_LED) for an example of using LedPin to control an RGB LED.

## *ServoPin(uint8_t pin [,double initDegrees [,uint16_t minMicros, uint16_t maxMicros, double minDegrees, double maxDegrees]])*

Creating an instance of this **class** configures the specified *pin* to output a 50 Hz PWM signal, which is suitable for controlling most Servo Motors.  There are three forms of the constructor: one with just a single argument; one with two arguments; and one with all six arguments.  Arguments, along with their defaults if left unspecified, are as follows:

  * *pin* - the pin on which the PWM control signal will be output.  The control wire of a Servo Motor should be connected this pin
  * *initDegrees* - the initial position (in degrees) to which the Servo Motor should be set (default=0¬∞)
  * *minMicros* - the pulse width (in microseconds) that moves the Servo Motor to its "minimium" position of *minDegrees* (default=1000ùõçs)
  * *maxMicros* - the pulse width (in microseconds) that moves the Servo Motor to its "maximum" position of *maxDegrees* (default=2000ùõçs)
  * *minDegrees* - the position (in degrees) to which the Servo Motor moves when receiving a pulse width of *minMicros* (default=-90¬∞)
  * *maxDegrees* - the position (in degrees) to which the Servo Motor moves when receiving a pulse width of *maxMicros* (default=90¬∞)

The *minMicros* parameter must be less than the *maxMicros* parameter, but setting *minDegrees* to a value greater than *maxDegrees* is allowed and can be used to reverse the minimum and maximum positions of the Servo Motor. The following methods are supported:

* `void set(double position)`

  * sets the position of the Servo Motor to *position* (in degrees).  In order to protect the Servo Motor, values of *position* less than *minDegrees* are automatically reset to *minDegrees*, and values greater than *maxDegrees* are automatically reset to *maxDegrees*.
  
* `int getPin()`

  * returns the pin number (or -1 if ServoPin was not successfully initialized)

A worked example showing how ServoPin can be used to control the Horizontal Tilt of a motorized Window Shade can be found in the Arduino IDE under [*File ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí HomeSpan ‚Üí Other Examples ‚Üí ServoControl*](../Other%20Examples/ServoControl).

### PWM Resource Allocation and Limitations

The following PWM resources are available:

* ESP32: 16 Channels / 8 Timers (arranged in two distinct sets of 8 Channels and 4 Timers)
* ESP32-S2: 8 Channels / 4 Timers
* ESP32-C3: 6 Channels / 4 Timers

HomeSpan *automatically* allocates Channels and Timers to LedPin and ServoPin objects as they are instantiated. Every pin assigned consumes a single Channel;  every *unique* frequency specified among all channels (within the same set, for the ESP32) consumes a single Timer.  HomeSpan will conserve resources by re-using the same Timer for all Channels operating at the same frequency.  *HomeSpan also automatically configures each Timer to support the maximum duty-resolution possible for the frequency specified.*

HomeSpan will report a non-fatal error message to the Arduino Serial Monitor when insufficient Channel or Timer resources prevent the creation of a new LedPin or ServoPin object.  Calls to the `set()` method for objects that failed to be properly created are silently ignored.
